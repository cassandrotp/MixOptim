\title{Performs a specific range optimization}
\usage{
mixtureRangeOptim(
  functions,
  desirabilityModel,
  midPoints,
  alpha,
  step = 0.01,
  plot = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{functions}{An array of functions}

\item{desirabilityModel}{A desirability overallD model}

\item{midPoints}{An array with the references (mid-points) for the optimization}

\item{alpha}{Defines the range of the seach, as startPoint +- alpha for each x value}

\item{step}{The ammount of each increment in the optimization}

\item{plot}{Define is the data frame that can be used for the desirabilityPlot function will be create. Strongly affects performance}
}
\value{
A list containg the data regarding the maximum desirability found
}
\description{
This function performs a optimization testing within an interval defined
by the user using alpha values for each middle point. It allows the
generation of the data frame for plotting.
